Analysis of data by month

ANALYSIS METHODS

PANDAS
Saved Google spreadsheet as a CSV file.
Imported CSV file read by Pandas.
Read file and loaded into a dataframe.
Created new columns "month" and "month_year" for counts and comparisons.
Observation: October is the month when the highest percentage of clients are contacged.
Conclusion: October is the best month to launch.

I illustrated the number of unique client contacts aggregated by month with a line graph.

But is October the most popular month every year? 
The number of unique clients who were contacted by month for each by year was counted.
Observation: Not all clients were contacted each month. However October was still the same 
month every year when the highest percentage of clients were contacted. 

I illustrated the number of unique client contacts by month for each year and arranged it as 
a time series line graph.

Observation: Although most clients are contacted in October every year, there has been a 
downward trend from the high set in October 2013. In October 2013, the number of unique
contacts in October was 31, and by 2016 that number was down to 25.
