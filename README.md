Analysis of data by month

ANALYSIS METHODS

PANDAS  - 
Saved Google spreadsheet as a CSV file, and imported CSV file, read and loaded into a dataframe.
Created new columns "month" and "month_year" for counts and comparisons.
Observation: October is the month when the highest percentage of clients are contacted.
Conclusion: October is the best month to launch.

I illustrated the number of unique client contacts aggregated by month with a line graph.

But is October the month every year when the highest percentage of clients are contacted? 
I counted the number of unique clients who were contacted by month for each year. 
Observation: Not all clients were contacted each month. However October was still the month every 
year when the highest percentage of clients are contacted. 

I illustrated the number of unique client contacts by month for each year and arranged it as 
a time series line graph.

Observation: Although most clients are contacted in October every year, there has been a 
downward trend from the high set in October 2013 when the number of unique contacts was 31 from 35 clients
and by 2016 that number was down to 25. It uis assumed that the same number of clients were the same for the whole
dataset and that new clients were not added, not did clients leave.
